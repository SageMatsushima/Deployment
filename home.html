    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
        During my sophomore fall semester at Brown, my UI/UX class assigned me a project to familiarize us with DOM and
        its capabilities. Using both JavaScript and React, we had to create a website that had different filter
        properties: 2 categories and a sort filter. We also had to incorporate an aggregator for the items on the
        website that totalled the prices for each item. I ended up making a fictional "superhero" website that let the
        user "purchase" superheroes and their abilities for a day.

        result, we had to first understand the audience that would use this platform. From the description, this product
        was based on video and game interactions. Therefore, my partner and I decided to combine common online video
        game services layout as well as video interaction services layouts to help users navigate the new product. This
        way, there is a familiarity to the user to help them understand and interact with this new workspace.
